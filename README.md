# Cooksy

Cooksy is a recipe and cookbook app with a social media twist. You can store your own recipes, collect them into custom cookbooks, and interact with a community of fellow home chefs. Users can Yum (our version of "liking" a post), favorite recipes they love, and leave reviews on others' creations.

It’s a modern-day digital cookbook designed to inspire creativity in the kitchen and build connections between food lovers.

## Why I Built This

I built Cooksy because I was tired of never having a good answer when my girlfriend asked, “What do you want for dinner?” or wanted to plan meals for the week. Existing recipe apps and websites felt cluttered and hard to navigate. I wanted something clean, personal, and easy to use—so I made it myself.
